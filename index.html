Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

								<p>
									Giveth is an open source platform that will enable people to build communities around causes.

									Our Donation Application (Dapp) empowers <strong>Givers</strong> and <strong>Makers</strong> to work together toward achieving a common goal.
								</p>
								<p>
									Campaigns raising funds with Giveth can be trusted because of a mix of blockchain based transparency and social accountability.
								</p>
								<p>
									Makers create milestones with the intent to make the world a better a place. The system to fund these milestones runs on the Ethereum blockchain to enable a high level of security and transparent accounting, so you can donate to your favorite cause, know <em>exactly</em> where your donation went, what it <em>accomplished</em> and most important:

									<strong>Know the <em>details</em> of the whole process!</strong>

								<p>Whether it is establishing a sustainable power source in an impoverished area, or organizing a recycling campaign - any community can use the Giveth platform to fight for their cause and find other people that share their excitement.
								</p>
								<p>
								Giveth encourages organization of efforts and sharing of resources, so communities can tackle global and local problems together. Giveth facilitates these connections, so strong communities can be built upon a foundation of transparency and accountability, guaranteed by blockchain tech.

								<p style="text-align: justify">
									Our smart contracts aim to establish a trustless system. You support your favorite cause and know the details about where your money is being used - the system tracks everything. Instead of donating and <em>hoping it produces a desirable outcome</em>, the donation can be locked into a descriptive milestone that is released to the charity only for proof of results, incentivizing them be responsible and economical.

									<p>
										We strongly believe in open source culture. All of our software is considered a gift to the Ethereum community.
										<br>
										Developers can use our base system as a launching pad to test their for-profit ideas. Imagine starting a decentralized charity to build an orphanage while testing an experimental governance system for allocating donations. Live smart contract testing while making the world a better place.

									<p class="justify">
										The MiniMe token makes it trivial for ANYONE to upgrade a Dapp/DAO midstream to include
										new features in a decentralized fashion, without having to migrate to a new token
										contract and without having to ask for permission.

										The Vault Contract is designed to hold ether and safely automate payments in a Dapp/DAO environment. It allows for a step-by-step decentralization process as trust in the code base is built over time.

									<h3>Delegated Governance</h3>
									<p class="justify">
										One of the core contracts we are working on enables a donor to delegate authority over their donations in a
										simple gas efficient way, following the principles of liquid democracy.

								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Milestone Payouts</h3>
									<p class="justify">
										Our milestone contracts, once fully tested, are able to keep organizations and causes accountable to their supporters. Breaking down lump sum amounts and ensuring milestones completion is an approach that would help all types of organizations ( profit or non-profits), as well as the current ICO ecosystem, by giving that extra level of conrol, ensuring that contributed funds are well spent.
